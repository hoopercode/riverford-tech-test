# Riverford Front-end Engineer Technical Test

We would like you to create a working version of the form seen in the `designs`
folder, displaying a 'processing' and then 'success' state after the form
submits.

We don't need the form to connect to an external resource, you can simulate these
states however you wish.

The designs are deliberately loosely defined in relation to breakpoints, gaps,
and alignment. We're interested in seeing how you’re able to interpret the
designs and achieve a responsive solution that adheres to them as best you can.
Image assets are provided in the `assets` folder.

Consider how to make your solution as pleasant to use as possible.

You may use any tools you see fit, but we’d like a minimum of an HTML, CSS and JS
file. If you choose a larger build structure / framework, ensure you provide us
with the necessary build instructions; you may use a package manager if you wish.
Use of a framework is not prefered, we're very happy to see a lightweight
solution. We're much more interested in the work *you* can do than any reliance
on 3rd-party tooling.

Please provide us your solution in a private GitHub or GitLab repo.

Good luck!
